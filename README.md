## Architecture Overview

This system implements a comprehensive disaster recovery solution designed specifically for Canadian healthcare organizations requiring PIPEDA compliance. Built using AWS serverless technologies, it provides automated data replication, compliance monitoring, and disaster recovery capabilities across multiple regions.

## Key Features

* âœ… **Multi-Region Replication**: Automated S3 cross-region replication with 15-minute RTO
* âœ… **PIPEDA Compliance**: Built-in Canadian privacy law compliance validation
* âœ… **Global Database**: DynamoDB Global Tables for bi-directional data synchronization
* âœ… **Automated Monitoring**: Lambda-based health checks and compliance auditing
* âœ… **Cost Optimized**: Free-tier compliant implementation under \$0.10/month
* âœ… **Enterprise Security**: AES-256 encryption, comprehensive audit trails
